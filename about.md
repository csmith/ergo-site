Ergo is a modern IRCd (IRC server software) written in Go.

Our core design principles are:

* Being simple to set up and use.
* Combining the features of an ircd, a services framework, and a bouncer (integrated account management, history storage, and bouncer functionality).
* Bleeding-edge [IRCv3 support](https://ircv3.net/software/servers.html) suitable for use as an IRCv3 reference implementation.
* High customizability via a rehashable (i.e., reloadable at runtime) YAML config.
